		"description": "We set a new speed record for hardware provisioning at Yahoo! This was in response to an emergency hardware request made by the YAMAS team at 3:30 PM on Tuesday 12/16. The request made it through the IA process and was allocated quota at 11:02 AM on Wednesday 12/17, for a total time of 19.5 hours. This included a mere 22 minutes from the final IA approval to quota allocation. A request like this would normally take days, if not weeks to process! Thanks to the efforts of GSCC, PEG, CARWash Team, DCO and Jacqueline Chin, along with OpenStack Baremetal for making this amazing feat possible.",

Yamas2 is the next-gen monitoring solution for Yahoo. It was completely re-architected to address challenges around scalability and complexity, aligning with Yahoo software evolution. <p>One of the focus areas included making the UI developer friendly. The new design aligns with the company intelligent CD and automation requirements. With this milestone, Yahoo <b>PEs</b> and <b>developers</b> are invited to look at their data with high resolution, and easily create views of their system and application health. We are targeting an overall Yahoo adoption of Yamas2 in 2015, starting with Platform migration to Yamas2 reports in Q1.",

The request made it through the IA process and was allocated quota at 11:02 AM on Wednesday 12/17, for a total time of 19.5 hours. This included a mere 22 minutes from the final IA approval to quota allocation. A request like this would normally take days, if not weeks to process! Thanks to the efforts of GSCC, PEG, CARWash Team, DCO and Jacqueline Chin, along with OpenStack Baremetal for making this amazing feat possible.",
